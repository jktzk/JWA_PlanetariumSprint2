# Planetarium - Sprint 2

## Overview

This project represents the second sprint in a QA Automation simulation for the Planetarium application, developed during Revature’s QA training program. The focus of Sprint 2 was on automated **unit testing** and **integration testing** of the Planetarium backend using **Java**, **JUnit**, **Mockito**, and **Rest Assured**.

Building upon Sprint 1, which emphasized end-to-end testing and STLC planning, this sprint targeted backend validation across API controllers, service layer logic, and repository behavior.

## Objectives

- Validate API controllers handle requests and responses correctly
- Ensure the service layer enforces business logic as expected
- Confirm repository methods interact with the database properly
- Generate structured reports for test execution (HTML and XML)

## Tools & Technologies

- Java  
- JUnit  
- Mockito  
- Rest Assured  
- GitHub  
- Jira  
- HTML/XML Reporting

## Test Strategy

This sprint followed a structured Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC):

1. **Test Analysis** – Reviewed requirements and updated the RTM  
2. **Test Planning** – Created test conditions and updated Jira sprint  
3. **Test Design** – Wrote unit and integration test cases  
4. **Test Environment Setup** – Prepared test data and environment  
5. **Test Execution** – Ran tests and validated outcomes  
6. **Test Closure** – Generated reports and logged defects
